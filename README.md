## Motivation

As opposed to measuring SPM, which is already offered by numerous other Android apps, this app is aimed to actually set it by beeping, i.e. acting as metronome.

This is meant to enable coaches and athletes to explore new ways of workout, possibly using auditory stimulus to increase concentration in training.

## Installation

This is an ordinary Android Studio project, it should work by simply downloading it and opening the build.gradle file in Android studio with default settings.
